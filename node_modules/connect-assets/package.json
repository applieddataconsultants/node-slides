Serve `.coffee` ([CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)) files as compiled `.js`\n1. Concatenate `.coffee` and `.js` together using [Snockets](https://github.com/TrevorBurnham/snockets)\n1. Serve `.styl` ([Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/)) as compiled `.css` with\n    -  [nib](https://github.com/visionmedia/nib) \n    -  [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/shomeya/bootstrap-stylus)\n1. Serve `.less` ([Less](http://lesscss.org/)) as compiled `.css` with\n    - [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) \n1. Serve files with an MD5 hash suffix and use a far-future expires header for maximum efficiency\n1. Avoid redundant git diffs by storing compiled `.js` and `.css` files in memory rather than writing them to the disk—except when you want them (e.g. for deployment to a CDN).\n\n## How?\n\nFirst, install it in your project's directory:\n\n    npm install connect-assets\n\nAlso install any specific compilers you'll need, e.g.:\n\n    npm install coffee-script\n    npm install stylus\n    npm install nib\n    npm install bootstrap-stylus\n    npm install less\n\nThen add this line to your app's configuration:\n\n    app.use require('connect-assets')()\n\nFinally, create an `assets` directory in your project and throw all your `.coffee` files in /assets/js and `.styl`, `.less` files in /assets/css.\n\n### Markup functions\n\nconnect-assets provides two global functions named `js` and `css`. Use them in your views. They tell connect-assets to do any necessary compilation, then return the markup you need. For instance, in a [Jade template](http://jade-lang.com/), the code\n\n    != css('normalize')\n    != js('jquery')\n\n(where `!= is Jade's syntax for running JS and displaying its output) results in the markup\n\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/css/normalize.css'>\n    <script src='/js/jquery.js'></script>\n\n### Sprockets-style concatenation\n\nYou can indicate dependencies in your CoffeeScript files using the Sprockets-style syntax\n\n    #= require dependency\n\n(or `//= require dependency` in JavaScript). When you do so, and point the `js` function at that file, two things can happen:\n\n1. By default, you'll get multiple `<script>` tags out, in an order that gives you all of your dependencies.\n2. If you passed the `build: true` option to connect-assets (enabled by default when `process.env.NODE_ENV == 'production'`), you'll just get a single tag, wich will point to a JavaScript file that encompasses the target's entire dependency graph—compiled, concatenated, and minified (with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)).\n\nIf you want to bring in a whole folder of scripts, use\n\n    #= require_tree dir\n\nSee [Snockets](http://github.com/TrevorBurnham/snockets) for more information.\n\n**Note:** CSS concatenation is not supported by connect-assets directly, because Stylus and Less already do a fine job of this. Stylus and Less are basically supersets of CSS, so just rename your `.css` files to `.styl` or `.less` and learn about the @import ([Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/docs/import.html), [Less](http://lesscss.org/#-importing)) syntax.\n\n## Options\n\nIf you like, you can pass any of these options to the function returned by `require('connect-assets')`:\n\n* `src` (defaults to `'assets'`): The directory assets will be read from\n* `helperContext` (defaults to `global`): The object the `css` and `js` helper functions will attach to\n* `buildDir` (defaults to `builtAssets`): Writes built asset files to disk using this directory in `production` environment, set to `false` to disable \n* ... see the source (`src/assets.coffee`) for more.\n\nYou can also set the \"root path\" on the `css` and `js` helper functions (by default, `/css` and `/js`), e.g.\n\n    css.root = '/stylesheets'\n    js.root  = '/javascripts'\n\nTo override these roots, start a path with `'/'`. So, for instance,\n\n    css('style.css')\n\ngenerates\n\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/css/style.css'>\n\nwhile\n\n    css('/style.css')\n\ngives you\n\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/style.css'>\n\n## Credits\n\nBorrows heavily from Connect's [compiler](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/1.6.4/lib/middleware/compiler.js) and [static](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/1.6.4/lib/middleware/static.js) middlewares, and of course sstephenson's [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets).\n\nContributors: [hasenj](https://github.com/hasenj), [TrevorBurnham](https://github.com/TrevorBurnham/).\n\n## License\n\n©2011 Trevor Burnham and available under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php):\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
